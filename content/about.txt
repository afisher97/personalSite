I'm an engineer driven by curiosity, creativity, and a passion for solving challenging problems. Whether I'm coming up with new innovative solutions, troubleshooting complex systems, or getting hands-on with a new project, I'm always eager to learn and grow. Currently, I'm an Electrical Engineer at Raytheon, where I lead engineering tasks from development to production, optimizing systems through careful analysis and automation.

Outside work, my engineering mindset blends into my hobbies. I enjoy modifying and working on vehicles, continually learning through hands-on experience. I'm also passionate about astrophotography. I enjoy spending nights capturing the photos of the night sky (the background image you're seeing is one of my shots!). Additionally, I built this website from scratch in Python as another outlet for creativity and learning.

Beyond engineering and photography, I am committed to continuous personal and professional growth. I earned my master's degree while working full-time. Additionally, I regularly experiment with coding and electronics projects at home, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn something new.
