1. Dark Navy + Soft Yellow

Background: #0a192f

    This is deep navy, which pairs well with bright accent colors.
    Alternatively, you can darken it slightly (e.g., #081526) for even more contrast.

Primary Text: #ccd6f6

    A light, cool gray with a hint of blue. Very readable on the dark navy background.

Accent (Yellow): #FFD700

    A classic “golden” yellow. Bold enough to stand out for links, buttons, hover states.

Hover Accent (Lighter Yellow): #FFEC85

    Lighten the accent for a hover effect. This keeps a consistent palette but adds a noticeable change on hover.

Usage

    Links/Buttons: color: #FFD700; (hover: #FFEC85)
    Headings: Use the primary text color (#ccd6f6) or pure white (#ffffff)
    Body Text: #ccd6f6



Why #081526 Works

    High Contrast: Yellow and teal/navy are complementary in terms of warmth/coolness, so yellow stands out well.
    Professional Yet Modern: Dark navy is a common choice for modern UIs. #081526 is a touch deeper and more teal, giving it a fresh twist.
    Easy on the Eyes: Dark backgrounds reduce glare, and the subtle hue is more interesting than a plain black.

Other Modern Dark Options

If you ever want to experiment with something else, here are some popular dark “neutrals” that still pair nicely with yellow accents:

    #121212 (Pure “Material” dark): A near-black used in many “night mode” UIs.
    #1f1f1f (Deep Charcoal): Subtly gray, extremely neutral, great for bright accent colors.
    #232629 (Dark Gray w/ a hint of blue): Used by GitHub’s dark mode, also pairs well with vibrant hues.
    #0D1117 (GitHub’s default “dark”): Slightly bluish black, quite modern.

All of these can work with a bright yellow accent—the difference is whether you want a hint of blue/teal (like #081526) or a neutral gray/black background.
Bottom Line

    #081526 is already a “modern dark” color, especially if you love the subtle teal cast.
    Bright yellow on top provides the contrast needed to guide the user’s eye and highlight important elements.
    If you ever want a more “neutral” feel, try a near-black or deep charcoal.
    Ultimately, use whichever feels right for your brand, taste, and content. If #081526 looks good to you, you can absolutely stick with it!
