            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Today in the Vatican the Eucharist was celebrated, dedicated in particular to the artists who have come from various parts of the world to experience the Jubilee days," the cardinal said, relaying the pope's words. "I thank the Dicastery for Culture and Education for the preparation of this appointment, which reminds us of the importance of art as a universal language that spreads beauty and unites peoples, contributing to bringing harmony into the world and silencing every cry of war."

    Thanking the artists participating in the service, Francis added via the prepared homily, "I would have liked to be among you but, as you know, I am here at the Gemelli Hospital because I still need some treatment for my bronchitis."

    "Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you are accompanying me in these days, and I would like to thank the doctors and health care workers in this hospital for their care: they do such a valuable and tiring job, let us support them with prayer," the pope wrote.</p>
